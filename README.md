Posy is not maintained. It's been imported from code.google.com for historical reference.

The project was started for two reasons:

1. solve a practical task
1. play with ToscaWidgets, internationalization and other features in TurboGears 2

Both points are obsolete by now since:

1. I don't use Plurk and LiveJrounal anymore and almost never tweet
1. I dropped server-side HTML generation in favor of AngularJS + HTTP API

# posy

Posy is a simple and secure web application for updating multiple (micro-)blogs and social networks quickly. For instance, it can be used to update Twitter, Plurk and LiveJournal simultaneously with the same content.
